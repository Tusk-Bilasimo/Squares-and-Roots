# Squares-and-Roots

When talking about squared numbers we think of  n² or n x n, while doodling with numbers I stumbled on this:-

For all perfect squares
n² = the sum of all odd integers beginning from 1 up to the index value of n

While it is easy to calculate the n², finding the √n is more difficult. But since n is considerably smaller than n² it is a useful way to find the root of the smaller perfect squares, to do this:-

Make an index   		      1, 2, 3,  4,   5,   6,   7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  13......

List the odd integers 		1, 3, 5,  7,   9,  11,  13, 15, 17,  19,  21,  23,  25......

List the perfect squares	   4, 9,  16,  25, 36,  49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169......


Notice
The index list corresponds to the odd integers:  2n-1

The index list corresponds to the perfect squares:  n²

The odd integers correspond to the perfect squares: 2n-1 is the space between consecutive perfect squares and the sum of the odd integers = n²

E.g. The odd integers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 has an index value of 5 and the sum of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9  is 25 the square of 5. Also by extension the next odd integer 11 is the space between the following perfect square
